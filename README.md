# fecviz_backend

This is where we will store our code for backend and visualization of data.

The "bluebonnet.py" file currently in report_gen will become a general module we can use for general Campaign finance processing tasks.

It currently includes a ``Campaign`` and ``State`` object. More documentation will come, but you can currently read the code to get an idea of the members of those two classes.
